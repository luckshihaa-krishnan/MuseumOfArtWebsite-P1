## MUSEUM OF ART - PART 1

#### Published URL : https://luckshihaakrishnan-museumofartwebsite.onrender.com

This is the third project I did in the course which focuses on using more features in React such as using a form, search button and displaying the data in the shape of cards. This application has a home page which displays a photo and description of the Museum, a search page which lets the user do an advanced search of an art work, its location and medium, a search bar that lets the user search the artwork based on the name, a page that displays the artwork based on the users' search, and an artwork detail page of a specific artwork which shows more details of the artwork such as the date, artist, classification, etc.

During the process in creating this application, I was able to achieve in creating the form for the Advanced Search page and making sure when the user clicks the submit button, it will take the user to the following path: '/artwork?true=true&geoLocation=&medium=Paintings&isOnView=false&isHighlight=false&q=cherry' (for example if the user searched 'Cherry' and the 'Title' as a 'Paintings'). Similar to using the search bar, it should take the user to the following path: '/artwork?title=true&q=apple' (for example if the user searched 'Apple'). Also, I made sure that the artwork cards were lined up properly and the width of the cards are all the same as well as the home page was neat and organized since the users will explore this website based on the first appearance.

Overall, I believed that I achieved this application when taking in consideration of easy useability and neatness of the application.

The command to run this application is 'npm run dev'. After this command is typed in the terminal, it will give a link to where we can see the application (for example, localhost:3000). This link would lead us to the application in the browser.
